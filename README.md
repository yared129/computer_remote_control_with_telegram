# Computer Remote Control With Telegram
## Step One: Create a Telegram Bot
To begin using this project you have to first make your own telegram bot. 
You start doing that by messaging [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to create a new telegram bot.

After [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) has successfully created a new bot for you, you have to replace the API TOKEN in [main.py](https://github.com/yaraedtek/computer_remote_control_with_telegram/blob/main/main.py) with the API TOKEN [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) has given you.
## Step Three: Install packages 
You have to install all the packages using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Step Four: Run the program 
You can run the file by using:
